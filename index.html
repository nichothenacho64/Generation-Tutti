                        Despite widespread awareness of the idea that languages change over time, <strong>
                            we lack a clear, data-driven
                            understanding of how everyday conversation really differs between generations in
                            Italy</strong>. This is not just in terms of
                        vocabulary, but also tone, sentiment, and dialectal variation, where we explore how Italian not
                        only changes as a spoken
                        language but as a form of expression for many Italians. So you might ponder on questions like
                        the following:
                    </p>
                    <p class="quote-text">
                        Do younger and older generations express themselves in the same way?<br>
                        How much of the Italian language is shared across generations, and how much is changing with
                        times?<br>
                        Is regional language/dialect use really declining, or is its use just changing?<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's the problem: Aspects like these are rarely visualised or compared in a systematic way,
                        especially using real,
                        organic, everyday conversational data. There is no accessible, interactive way to <span
                            class="coloured-text">see</span>
                        and <span class="coloured-text">hear</span> how language evolves from one generation to the
                        next.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="top-heading">Significance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Languages are constantly evolving thanks to many factors from techological to social changes.
                        Such changes are
                        are especially sophisticated due to linguistic diversity, the cultural value of speech, changes
                        in self-expression, etc.
                        Previous studies have examined linguistic change in an academic context, though the everyday
                        spoken
                        language (i.e. how we speak in informal quotidian contexts) remains underexplored, especially
                        across different generations.
                        Hence, in our research, we aim to <strong>compare and contrast the nature of
                            everyday conversations in Italy across generations.</strong>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The researchers at KIParla define free conversations as those that have spontaneous
                        conversational speech among people all
                        across the country (Mauri et al., 2022), without any instructions from the research.
                        Accordingly, we define ‘everyday conversations’ as those
                        that have no thematic alignment and unfold organically in recreational settings such as meals.
                        However, based on widespread consensus as well as new Gen Z analysis by the Pew Research Center,
                        and the one generation
                        defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (Baby Boomers), these are the birth years and ages of the
                        generations you’ll want to use in 2025.
                        We have drawn on the Pew Research Center’s definitions for the age range of each generation,
                        given their widespread consensus
                        in the USA (Dimock, 2018). Though there are specific definitions like these, we have had to
                        accommodate for the fact that
                        each participant had an age range rather than a specific age; hence, our definitions may differ
                        slightly.

                    <h3>A Generational Mood Swing: From Negativity and Less Expression to Positivity and More Expression</h3>
                    <p>
                        How do you think your parents' conversations sound compared to your own? Our data reveals a significant emotional divide.
                        The chart below shows the sentiment of everyday conversations for the four generations of Italians examined.
                    </p>
                    <div id="sentimentBarChart" class="chart full-width-chart"></div>
                    <p>
                        While <strong>Baby Boomer</strong> and <strong>Generation X</strong> conversations are predominantly 
                        <strong>negative</strong> (46.3% and 50% respectively), Generation Y and Generation Z have completely gone the other way, 
                        recording <strong>positive sentiment</strong> both at 47.5%.
                        This is not merely about <span class="coloured-text">what</span> they feel, but <span class="coloured-text">how</span> they express it. The way that generations use their
                        voices through their pitch, volume, and pace also shares a compelling story. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>How does linguistic change sound?</h3>
                    <div id="prosodicLineChart" class="chart full-width-chart"></div>
                    <p>
                        In the chart above, we can see that younger Italians speak with more animation. Their more frequent use of <strong>raised volume</strong>
                        and <strong>rising intonation (normal and weak)</strong> is significantly higher than that of older generations. Baby Boomers, instead 
                        have more similar levels of <strong>low volume</strong> and <strong>slowing down</strong>, perhaps indicative of their
                        more reserved conversational style. This reveals two distinctive conversational styles: one that is lively and dynamic, and another that is more
                        calm and measured.

                    <h3>Do us Italians still speak the same language?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the emotional tone, what about the words themselves? We analysed many lemmas 
                        (i.e. the base form of words, excluding those with fewer than 3 letters) to see the vocabulary that unites and divides the generations.
                    </p>
                    <button id="lemmaHeatmapSort" class="btn btn-primary styled-button">Switch sort attribute</button>
                    <div id="lemmaHeatmap" class="chart"></div>
                    <p>At first glance, a common conversational foundation is apparent. Basic perceptive and communicative verbs like 
                        <span class="fst-italic">vedere</span> (to see)
                        <span class="fst-italic">parlare</span> (to speak)
                        <span class="fst-italic">sentire</span> (to hear/feel)
                        are common across all generations.
                        However, the linguistic story takes a sharp turn with <strong>Generation Z</strong> when we
                        examine the delta change in generations. 
                        Their use of many common verbs drops significantly. For example, the frequency of 
                        <span class="fst-italic">prendere</span> (to take) drops from a high of 19.9 for Baby Boomers to just 0.6 for Generation Z.
                        Furthermore, verbs like <span class="fst-italic">andare</span> (to go) and <span class="fst-italic">mangiare</span> (to eat)
                        have illustrated an increase, highlighting the importance of everyday important tasks in their conversations.
                        This change in vocabulary additionally reflects a shift in <span class="coloured-text">what</span> generations talk about.
                    </p>
                    <h3>From deeper discussions to casual chats</h3>
                    <div id="themesRadarChart" class="chart"></div>
                    <p>
                        Older generations gravitate towards <strong>discussions</strong>; meanwhile, younger generations tend to prefer
                        lighter, more casual <strong>conversation pieces</strong>. For these Italians, it seems that the very purpose
                        of everyday conversations is changing, from discussions towards more informal connection and sharing.

                    <h3>The surprising truth about Italian dialects/regional languages</h3>
                    <p>
                        We've all heard the standard narrative that local dialects are disappearing in favour of standard Italian.
                        However, our data reveals a more fascinating and nuanced reality.
                    </p>
                    <div id="dialectsDeltaChoroplethMap" class="chart"><svg id="patternLayer"></svg></div>
                    <p>
                        This map uncovers some of the most unexpected findings in the project. While dialect usage is declining in parts of the North
                        (in grey areas, particularly Veneto, with a 14.9% decrease), it is making a <strong>significant comeback in the South</strong>, 
                        in particular, in <strong>Puglia</strong> (in the red area). Instead of merely being a thing of the past, dialect usage in Puglia
                        appears to be a growing part of modern identity for younger generations, directly challenging the idea of a uniform decline in dialect usage.
                        This trend is not only about geography. A closer look reveals that where people live, their generation, and educational background strongly
                        shape the usage of dialect in their conversations.

                    <p>
                        As the charts illustrate, dialect use has some relationship to a participant's <strong>educational background</strong> and
                        <strong>macro region</strong>. When examining each conversation, those with people from an elementary or middle school education
                        tend to have a higher frequency of dialect words, though this does not show a significant correlation with the average age of participants. 
                        As seen previously, southern conversations show a steady increase in the usage of dialect. This once again proves that dialect is not just
                        a remnant of the past, but a living, evolving feature of modern Italian identity.

                    <p>
                        Our journey through everyday conversations all across Italy demonstrate Italy as a linguistically transitioning nation. We've witnessed a
                        profound <strong>emotional shift</strong>, with younger generations bringing a wave of positivity and expression to their chats.
                        We've uncovered <strong>lexical divergences</strong>, as Generation Z redefines everyday conversation with vocabulary changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most surprisingly, we've debunked the myth of disappearing dialects across the country. In its place, we find a 
                        <strong>regional alignment</strong> where dialect is not just surviving, but thriving in the South, re-emerging as a marker of
                        local and regional identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The data found highlights a fascinating tension between national linguistic standards and perceptions and the persistent power of regional
                        and generational identity. There is no single 'Italian way' of speaking, but many. Whilst the data analysed in this project is not super extensive,
                        it nonetheless postulates the idea that the Italian language is a vibrant, living organism that reflects our emotions, our culture, and our
                        identity and place in a rapidly changing world.
